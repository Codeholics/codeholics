I love mobile computing, and I love coding. It is only natural that I would want to do some coding on the go. C4android lets you do just that if you enjoy coding in C/C++ and want to do it easily on your Android device. C4android is a nice lightweight IDE that interfaces nicely with the GCC compiler and GDB debugger making it easy to work on any size C/C++ project while on the go. It is also great if your going over an eBook. You can flip back and forth between the book and C4android to test out code examples. This was by far the best \$3 I ever spent on an app and would have spent more if asked to.

Check out C4android on the Google Play Store:
